            <h3>FTC Affiliate Disclosure</h3>
            <p>In accordance with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) guidelines, TrendLoop USA hereby discloses that this website contains affiliate links. When you click on these links and make a purchase, we may receive a commission at no additional cost to you. This compensation helps support the operation of this website and allows us to continue providing free, high-quality fashion content.</p>
            <p>Our affiliate relationships do not influence our editorial content, product recommendations, or reviews. We only recommend products and services that we genuinely believe will be valuable to our readers. All opinions expressed on this site are our own.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Amazon Associates Disclosure</h2>
            <p>TrendLoop USA is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for websites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>Required Disclosure:</strong> As an Amazon Associate, TrendLoop USA earns from qualifying purchases. This means that when you click on an Amazon product link on our site and make a purchase on Amazon.com, we may receive a small commission. This commission comes from Amazon and does not increase the price you pay for the product.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Our participation in the Amazon Associates Program means the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Product links on our site that direct you to Amazon.com are affiliate links</li>
                <li>We earn a commission (typically 1-10%, depending on product category) on qualifying purchases made through these links</li>
                <li>We have no control over Amazon's pricing, availability, or shipping policies</li>
                <li>Product prices and availability shown on our site may differ from what you see on Amazon.com at the time of purchase</li>
                <li>Amazon and the Amazon logo are trademarks of Amazon.com, Inc. or its affiliates</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We choose to include Amazon product links because Amazon offers a wide selection, competitive pricing, reliable shipping, and a trusted customer service experience. However, we encourage you to compare prices across retailers before making a purchase.</p>

            <p>In addition to the Amazon Associates Program, TrendLoop USA may participate in other affiliate programs and partnerships with retailers, brands, and affiliate networks. These may include, but are not limited to, programs offered by fashion retailers, department stores, and affiliate marketing platforms.</p>
            <p>The same principles apply to all our affiliate relationships:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We clearly identify content that contains affiliate links</li>

                <li>Clicking on an affiliate link does not increase the price you pay</li>

            <h2 class="section-title">Advertising Disclosure</h2>
            <p>TrendLoop USA displays advertisements through Google AdSense (publisher ID: ca-pub-8049649445649586) and potentially other advertising networks. These advertisements are served by third-party ad networks and are displayed based on various factors including your browsing history, interests, and geographic location.</p>
            <p>Important points about advertising on our site:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Advertisements are clearly distinguishable from editorial content</li>
                <li>The appearance of an advertisement on our site does not constitute an endorsement of the advertised product or service</li>
                <li>We do not control the specific ads that are displayed, as they are served by automated ad networks</li>
                <li>Ad revenue helps us maintain the site and produce free content for our readers</li>
                <li>You can manage your ad preferences through your browser settings or through Google's ad personalization controls</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="section-title">General Disclaimer</h2>
            <p>The information provided on TrendLoop USA is for general informational and entertainment purposes only. While we strive to provide accurate, up-to-date, and helpful content, we make no representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied, about the completeness, accuracy, reliability, suitability, or availability of the information, products, services, or related graphics contained on the Site.</p>

            <p><strong>Fashion and Style Advice:</strong> The fashion advice, style tips, and trend analysis published on TrendLoop USA represent the opinions and perspectives of our editorial team. Fashion is inherently subjective, and what works for one person may not work for another. We encourage readers to use our content as inspiration and guidance, but ultimately to make style choices that align with their personal preferences, body type, lifestyle, and budget.</p>

            <p><strong>Product Information:</strong> Product descriptions, prices, availability, and specifications mentioned on our site are subject to change without notice. We make reasonable efforts to ensure that product information is accurate at the time of publication, but we cannot guarantee that all details remain current. We recommend verifying product information directly with the retailer before making a purchase.</p>

            <p><strong>No Professional Advice:</strong> Nothing on this site should be construed as professional financial, legal, medical, or other professional advice. Our product recommendations and shopping guides are editorial in nature and should not be taken as professional endorsements.

            <h2 class="section-title">Editorial Independence</h2>
            <p>TrendLoop USA maintains a strict separation between editorial content and advertising or affiliate revenue. Our editorial team operates independently from our business relationships. The following principles guide our editorial process:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Honest reviews:</strong> When we review or recommend a product, our assessment is based on genuine evaluation of quality, value, and relevance to our audience. We never publish positive reviews in exchange for compensation.</li>
                <li><strong>Transparent disclosure:</strong> We clearly disclose all material connections, including affiliate relationships, sponsored content, and products received for review. We believe transparency is essential to maintaining reader trust.</li>
                <li><strong>Reader-first approach:</strong> Our primary obligation is to our readers. We will never recommend a product solely because of a higher affiliate commission. Our recommendations prioritize quality, value, and suitability for our audience.</li>
                <li><strong>No pay-for-play:</strong> Brands and retailers cannot pay for editorial coverage or guaranteed positive reviews on TrendLoop USA. Our editorial calendar and content decisions are made independently.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Sponsored Content</h2>
            <p>From time to time, TrendLoop USA may publish sponsored content or posts created in partnership with brands. When this occurs, we will always clearly label such content as "Sponsored," "Paid Partnership," or "In collaboration with [Brand Name]" at the beginning of the article.</p>
            <p>Even in sponsored content, we maintain editorial control over the opinions expressed and will not publish claims or endorsements that we do not genuinely support. Sponsored partnerships are accepted only when the brand and product align with our editorial standards and audience interests.</p>
